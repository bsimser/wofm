# Warlock Of Firetop Mountain : The Roguelike

## About

Deep in the caverns beneath Firetop Mountain lies an untold wealth of treasure, guarded by a powerful Warlock, or so the rumour goes.
Several adventurers like yourself have set off for Firetop Mountain in search of the Warlock's hoard. None have ever returned. Do you dare follow them?

You take the role of an adventurer on a quest to find the treasure of a powerful Warlock, hidden deep within Firetop Mountain. 
People from a nearby village advise that the treasure is stored in a chest with two locks, and that the keys are guarded by various creatures within the dungeons. 
You approach the shadow of the great mountain.

The local villages have warned you that the entrance is well guarded...

You character '@' starts outside the mountains entrance with the goal of entering and descending down the depths to destroy the "evil" warlock Zagor with the purpose of acquiring wealth and power.

Good luck!
